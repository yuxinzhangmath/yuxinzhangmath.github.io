I'm a Ph.D. candidate at [Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.amss.cas.cn) (AMSS, CAS).
My current research focuses on quantum algorithms and quantum complexity theory, especially query complexity. I am also broadly interested in other topics in quantum information science, particularly those with deep mathematical foundations, with the overarching goal of better understanding the structure of quantum advantage.

**I'm currently looking for a postdoc position.**
